# Scheduler

**Description:**  
A calendar/planner application that allows you to track assignments both for classes and for activities and clubs. The application will lets the user add/drop classes, homework assignments, activities, and tasks and prompt them periodically. Additionally, if the user specifies when they have freetime, the app will divy up their work for them to fill that time. Lastly, the user can put their computer into “study mode”, which will prompt them regularly at certain intervals to make sure they take regular breaks (for water/stretch their legs).

**Project Partners:**  
Aashil Desai and Alec Wang  
University of Pennsylvania | Class of 2019

**Current Progress:**  
Right now we're planning out the schedule we want to follow for the project (as well as who will do what). We also just set up the git repo (and committed the first things we each agreed to work on).
